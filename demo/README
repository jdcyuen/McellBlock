1. So the first thing our application app would do to allow our customers to access the 
   Gilded Rose inventory of items is to require them to register. This is so that we may have them
   authenticate and provide basic information necessary to purchase and item such as a credit card, etc.
   
2. The first line of defense normally for a REST API is to require the user to use a HTTPS connection however for 
   this example I chose not to implement that since it requires using a certificate and to keep the setup of this demo
   as simple as possible.
   
3. Next I would secure the REST API through the use of JSON web tokens (JWT).

4. So a Gilded Rose merchant would authenticate to the REST API after registering.
   Then receive back a JWT, and then thereafter past the JWT,  in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema, to the REST API.
   
5. Thereafter any communication with API must include the JWT token.

6. By receiving a token, the REST api can know that the merchant is authenticated.
